# Issues Identified and addressed in the second phase of development:

## Issues 

### Project Allocation leads to non-functional tab
##### Before:
![](bugs/Project_allocation.png)

##### After:
![](addressed_bugs_and_pages_created/Project_allocation.png)

\
Now project allocation redirects the page to assign projects styled papaer as expected. In that page using the preferences set by students for the projects published  in that course, the projects are assigned to the students

\
In <strong>CoursePage</strong>, the <strong>setComponent</strong> function is used to update the component state based on user interactions. The component state determines which part of the UI is rendered on the page.

![](addressed_bugs_and_pages_created/pa_set_component.png)

\
 **useState(1)** initializes the **component** state with the value 1. This means that by default, the **CoursesStudents** component (corresponding to component value 1) will be rendered when the page loads.

\
![](addressed_bugs_and_pages_created/assign_projects.png)

\
Three clickable elements representing different sections: **Student Management**, **Project Management**, and **Project Allocation**. Each element has an __onClick__ event handler that calls the __setComponent__ function with a specific value when clicked.

* When "Student Management" is clicked **(onClick={() => setComponent(1)})**, it sets the component **state** to 1.
* When "Project Management" is clicked **(onClick={() => setComponent(2)})**, it sets the component **state** to 2.
* When "Project Allocation" is clicked **(onClick={() => setComponent(3)})**, it sets the component **state** to 3.

\
![](addressed_bugs_and_pages_created/rendering_course_assignment_component.png)

\
The value passed to **setComponent** determines which section should be rendered, and the **renderComponent** function uses this state value to conditionally render the appropriate component (**CoursesStudents**, **CoursesProject**, or **CoursesAssignment**). The **component** state is then updated accordingly whenever the user clicks on one of the section buttons.

### Dahboard is empty

##### Before:
![](bugs/Dashboard.png)

##### After:
![](addressed_bugs_and_pages_created/Dashboard.png)

\
The **Admin dashboard** allows the admin to navigate to and between **Students**, **Courses**, **Clients** and **Projects**. And admin can access his profile through admin dashboard also can manage students, clients and projects.

\
![](addressed_bugs_and_pages_created/a_imports.png)



##### Card Creation:
![](addressed_bugs_and_pages_created/Grid_card1.png)
![](addressed_bugs_and_pages_created/Grid_card2.png)
![](addressed_bugs_and_pages_created/Grid_card3.png)

\
In this code snippet:

* Three cards for Courses, Clients, and Students are created using Material-UI's Card components.
* Each card has a CardMedia component to display an image, a CardContent component for the content, and CardActions for buttons.
* The buttons include actions such as navigating to specific pages (/courses, /pages, /students) and triggering functions (handleLearnMoreClick).

##### Redirection:
![](addressed_bugs_and_pages_created/redirection.png)

\
In this code snippet:

* The useNavigate hook is used to obtain the navigate function for programmatic navigation.
* Event handlers like handleLogout, handleLearnMoreClick, and handleLearnMoreClientsAndProjectsClick use the navigate function to redirect users to different pages when buttons are clicked.
* The combination of card creation and navigation event handlers provides a visually appealing dashboard with clickable sections that redirect the user to specific pages or trigger relevant actions.

### Students Page
##### Before:
    Null
##### After:
![](addressed_bugs_and_pages_created/StudentsPage.png)

##### Import Statements:
![](addressed_bugs_and_pages_created/Student_imports.png)

\
These are import statements for various React and Material-UI components, as well as custom components (**ConfirmationPopup**, **CSVUploader**, **Navbar**, **Footer**, and **FooterPlain**). It also imports styling-related components from Material-UI.

##### Styled Components:
![](addressed_bugs_and_pages_created/StyledComponent1.png)
![](addressed_bugs_and_pages_created/StyledComponent2.png)

\
These are styled components using the styled utility from Material-UI. They define the styling for various elements such as **InputBase**, **Paper**, **TableCell**, and **TableRow**

##### Functional Component:
![](addressed_bugs_and_pages_created/FunctionalComponent.png)

\
This is the main functional component named **Studentdata**. It uses React hooks (**useState**, **useEffect**) to manage state variables.

##### Event Handlers:
![](addressed_bugs_and_pages_created/EventHandler.png)

\
These functions handle various events such as clicking on a table row, changing the page, changing rows per page, and changing the search name.

##### useEffect for Fetching Data:
![](addressed_bugs_and_pages_created/s_useEffect.png)

\
The **useEffect** hook is used to fetch data from the server when the component mounts.

##### Delete User Function:
![](addressed_bugs_and_pages_created/s_delete.png)

\
These functions handle the deletion of a user when the confirmation popup is confirmed or denied.

##### Render JSX:
![](addressed_bugs_and_pages_created/s_render1.png)
![](addressed_bugs_and_pages_created/s_render2.png)
![](addressed_bugs_and_pages_created/s_render3.png)

\
The **return** statement renders the JSX structure of the component. It includes a **Navbar**, a main content section (**courses-students**), and a **Footer**.

##### Table and Pagination:
![](addressed_bugs_and_pages_created/s_table.png)
![](addressed_bugs_and_pages_created/s_pagination.png)

\
This section includes a **Toolbar** for search and actions, a **TableContainer** for displaying user data, and **TablePagination** for handling pagination.

##### TableRow and TableCell:
![](addressed_bugs_and_pages_created/tablecellandbody.png)

\
This maps over the user data to create **TableRow** components with **TableCell** components for each user's details.

\
Overall, this component fetches user data, displays it in a table, allows searching, and provides options for deleting users. It also includes styling and uses Material-UI components for a consistent design.

### Can't close projects tab

##### Before:
![](bugs/Projrcts_tab.png)

##### After:
![](addressed_bugs_and_pages_created/closing_projects_tab.png)

\
**project view** popup is being closed through the **handleClose** function. This function is passed as a prop to the **ProjectPreview** component, and it is invoked when the user clicks on the close icon within the popup.

##### Close Icon in the Popup:

* The close icon is implemented as an SVG icon within the popup-close div.

##### onClick Event:

* The onClick event is attached to the popup-close div.
* When a user clicks on the close icon, the handleClose function is invoked.

##### handleClose Function:

* The handleClose function is passed as a prop to the ProjectPreview component. It is a callback function provided by the parent component.
* This function is responsible for closing the popup. The specific implementation of this function is in the parent component that renders the ProjectPreview.

##### Closing the Popup:

* Inside the handleClose function, there is likely logic to hide or remove the popup from the view. This logic is implemented in the parent component.
* For example, the handleClose function might update the state in the parent component to hide the popup, or it might be part of a larger context or state management system.

##### CSS Styling:

* The CSS styling for the close icon includes a hover effect to make it more interactive.

### Cams Portal Deployment Documentation

\
This documentation provides step-by-step instructions on deploying the CAMS (Capstone Project Management System) portal on a Render server. Render is a cloud platform that simplifies deployment and hosting.
